## Decentralized Puzzle Game

## Vision 
The Decentralized Puzzle Game is an innovative blockchain-based platform where players can solve puzzles and earn rewards in the form of ERC-20 tokens. Leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, the game ensures transparent and fair gameplay by securely managing puzzle solutions and reward distribution. Our goal is to create an engaging, tamper-proof puzzle game that combines entertainment with the benefits of blockchain technology.
